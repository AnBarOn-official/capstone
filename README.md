### First Final Assignment: Description of the Problem and Data

1. Description of the problem and a discussion of the background

I want to consider the following situation: My friend approached me, since he wants to expand his cafe franchise to Frankfurt am Main/ Germany. Frankfurt is a city with many different kinds of cuisine: local and international and high frequency of business travelers and tourists, due to the closeness of the main airport and industry sector. Since he is not familiar with the city himself, he asked me to help him finding the perfect location. Therefore I will use clustering algorithms, geodata and population data to find the ideal district to open his new cafe.

2. Description of Data

The following Datasets have been used:
  a) Street Directory: https://offenedaten.frankfurt.de/dataset/strassenverzeichnis-der-stadt-frankfurt-am-main
  b) Demographic Information: https://offenedaten.frankfurt.de/dataset/stadtteilprofile-bevoelkerung
  c) GeoData: https://offenedaten.frankfurt.de/dataset/wahlatlas-2015-geodaten/resource/84dff094-ab75-431f-8c64-39606672f1da
  d) Foursquare API to find common venues in certain areas

I want to use the data to find:
- densely populated districts close to the center and connected to public transportation
- districts with not that many cafes and lots of hotels and restaurants (higher frequency of people)
- districts with many people in the age group of 18 to 64 (higher amount of money)
